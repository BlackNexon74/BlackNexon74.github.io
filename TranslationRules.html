    <p>You can found here the instructions of how our team work for the transcript. Regarding the translation, each team can work differently so be sure to contact your team for more information. If you are the only one in your team then you can work as you wish. IMPORTANT : if you translate NeverMore, be ready to be spoiled because you will see the episode before their release. The rules may be subject to slight changes.</p>

    <p>You can found here the instructions of how our team work for the transcript. Concerning the translations, each team can work differently so be sure to contact your team for more information. If you are the only one in your team then you can work as you wish. IMPORTANT : if you translate NeverMore, be ready to be spoiled because you will see the episode before their release. The rules may be subject to slight changes.</p>

      <p id="p1">In 1 you have the number of the chapter and the episode which you can also find in 2 and 3.<br>
          In 4 you have the number of the bubble or SFX.<br>
          In 5 a screenshot of the said bubble.<br>
          In 6 the author's comments, "SFX" or complementary notes.<br><br>
          What does "SFX" means ? "SFX" is a keyword used to describe an action like "grab" or "woosh". In the transcript it means that the sfx will need a redraw and a translator's note in the meantime</p>
